# Distribution Generalization in Dynamical Real-World Systems
This git implements some pooling and domain generalization methods, applied to the FLUXNET data. The methods implemented are the following
1. Linear Regression
2. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
4. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM)
5. Stabilized Regression (SR)

For reproducing the experiments, we assume that access to the FLUXNET data is given.
