  1) python/3.11.6     2) python_cuda/3.11.6

Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
  1) cuda/12.1.1     2) nccl/2.18.3-1     3) openblas/0.3.24

The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) gcc/12.2.0 => gcc/8.5.0     2) stack/2024-06 => stack/.2024-04-silent

Many modules are hidden in this stack. Use "module --show_hidden spider SOFTWARE" if you are not able to find the required software

The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) stack/.2024-04-silent => stack/2024-04
