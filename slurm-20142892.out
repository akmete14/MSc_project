Many modules are hidden in this stack. Use "module --show_hidden spider SOFTWARE" if you are not able to find the required software

The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) stack/.2024-04-silent => stack/2024-04


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  gcc: gcc/8.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "gcc/8.5.0" module is available to load.

      stack/.2024-04-silent
      stack/2024-04
